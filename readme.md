A project folder for object-oriented browser design course. Includes a text-based adventure game and a DOM weksite consisting of only one HTML-file. 
Working on this course really gave me a deeper understanding of JS.
 
 Be sure to run "npm install" to download all dependencies for guaranteed success. Then run "node index.js" to begin the game!
 
 
 Currently working on a more advanced and interactive version of the game.
