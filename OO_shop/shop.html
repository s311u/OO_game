                info: 'The British Shorthair, also called the English Cat or simply the “Brit,” is the national cat of the British Isles. This is a compact, muscular and powerful breed that should be "cobby" or chunky in appearance. The British Shorthair has a broad chest, short strong legs and large rounded paws. Its tail is thick at the base, round at the tip and plush but not fluffy. The males are almost always larger than the females; this size difference is more easily recognized in British Shorthairs than in most other domestic breeds. Unlike females, mature males tend to develop prominent chubby cheeks, or jowls, which is another distinguishing gender-based feature. \n \nThe British Shorthair – or the “Brit,” as it is sometimes affectionately called - is an easygoing, intelligent, friendly breed. It has been described as being placid, patient and predictable. The British Shorthair’s sweet and gentle nature makes them wonderful, steadfast companions and undemanding family members. They adapt easily to apartment, farm, city or estate living. These are not noisy or pushy cats, although they greatly appreciate and accept affection when it is offered to them.'
